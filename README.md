# nfl-team-clust
This project attempts to cluster NFL Teams (by team stats) into clusters that reflect playstyle. 

Team is defined as a franchise offense or defense for a given season (i.e. Philidelphia Eagles Offense from the 2017/2018 season). This is an attempt to mitigate variability from drafts/trades/management changes that occur during the off-season.

The dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016. Data for seasons from 2009 - 2018.
